Things to do to the ASL packages (in no particular order).

* Add a dictionary tree.

* Add stuff to tree iterators to support different type of tree traversals
  (prefix, postfix, breadth-first).

* Make heaps quickly searchable.  Probably should make it optional.

* Change the sed scripts to m4 or something a little better suited for
  the purpose.

* Add some more example programs.

* Add some dictionary stuff.

* Write better documentation.

* Get some mathematical packages.

* Write a graphics framework.
