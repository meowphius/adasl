*** This is the old (and misnamed) changelog.  Use ChangeLog for new stuff

Release 0.2 - 08/03/1998

* 08/03/1998 - Initial release.


Release 0.3 - 08/04/1998

* 08/04/1998 - Removed the discriminant from iterators since the
  implementation violated the language spec even though GNAT allowed
  it.  Thanks to Gene Ouye for finding this.

Release 0.4 - 08/13/1998

* 08/05/1998 - Removed the discriminant from the main hash container
  because it wasn't really necessary.

* 08/07/1998 - Renamed the object-based hierarchy to have an "_O"
  appended to all the names.  This fixes a namespace problem, it's
  pretty obvious that saying
	package Asoc.List is new Asoc.List;
  is not legal.  Thanks to Gene Ouye for finding this.

* 08/11/1998 - Started working on the graph container.

* 08/11/1998 - Fixed the "=" operator for hash tables so tables with
  the exact same members will return true, even if the members occur
  in a different order.

* 08/13/1998 - Finished the graph container.

* 08/13/1998 - Added a directed graph containers.  They were very
  similar to standard graphs, so using the sed scripts to modify the
  standard graph container seemed like the easiest way.  I could have
  made it a discriminant on the graph, but that would have required a
  discriminant (or wasted store) on every graph node, which didn't
  excite me very much.

Release 0.5 - 8/16/1998

* 08/14/1998 - Modified the graph containers to support user values on
  the links.  Also, they will conditionally allow multiple links
  between the same two nodes.  These were both major oversights in the
  design of graphs, thanks to Daniel Gaudry for pointing this out.

* 08/14/1998 - Moved all the tests to the tests directory.

* 08/15/1998 - Added an example program that prints minimal paths
  between states in the United States.  It is in the examples
  directory.

* 08/15/1998 - Fixed some bugs in the AList container.

Release 0.6 - 08/19/1998

* 08/17/1998 - Modified the graph container to have a separate callback
  for graph link values.

* 08/17/1998 - Started updating the internal documentation.

* 08/18/1998 - Changed the structure of graphs links to a more reasonable
  structure and made it more consistent.  This will require code changes
  for anyone using graphs, but it's not too bad.

* 08/18/1998 - More internal documentation and some restructuring in
  graphs, hash tables, heaps, ALists, DLists, and trees.

* 08/18/1998 - Removed the object-based graph entries.  They were just
  too hard to make work and probably not terribly useful.

* 08/19/1998 - Fixed some memory leaks in graph links.

* 08/19/1998 - Modified everything but the Objects and Iterators to not
  descend from Baseclass.Object.  This decision is based upon efficiency;
  Baseclass.Object is controlled and thus it has the overhead of the
  initialization, finalization, etc.  The contained members don't really
  need that (or if they do, it can be driven from the main object's
  controlled calls) so this is more efficient in terms of memory and
  time.  The graph link objects and iterators are also not controlled
  for the same reason (even though they are objects and iterators).

* 08/19/1998 - Pulled the sort out of Sortable and put it in its own
  package.  This will (hopefully) allow more flexible sort use.

* 08/19/1998 - Added a quicksort package.

* 08/19/1998 - Added a demo program from Daniel Gaudry and modified it
  to work with the containers.

Release 0.6a - 08/22/1998

* 08/22/1998 - Created scripts and makefiles to make a krunch-ed
  version of the packages.  Unfortunately, they were not clean for
  direct krunching by gnatchop, I had to make a gnat.adc file to
  translate filenames.

* 08/22/1998 - Baseclass.Limited_Object didn't derive from
  Limited controlled, that was corrected.

Release 0.7 - 08/27/1998

* 08/23/1998 - Moved the set operations from Asgc to Asgc.Setops,
  since they didn't really belong in Asgc directly.

* 08/23/1998 - Added a bunch of semaphores.

* 08/25/1998 - Created a set of managed containers, ones that have a storage
  pool specified for them.  These exactly mimick the regular containers
  except that they have "_Managed" appended to their name.

* 08/25/1998 - Modified the sed scripts to split out the functionality, so
  that, for instance, instead of using dynamic-digraph.sed you would use
  the dynamic.sed hen the digraph.sed.

* 08/25/1998 - Created a special storage pool for detecting memory leaks.

* 08/26/1998 - Added a new Add operation that adds a value to a container
  using an iterator.  The item is added to the iterator's container and the
  iterator is positioned on the new item.

* 08/26/1998 - Added two Add_Link routines to the graph container to add
  links between iterators and values.

* 08/26/1998 - Worked on tests for graphs, they are updated.

* 08/26/1998 - Fixed some leaks in the graph packages.

* 08/27/1998 - Finished up the most of the updates to the tests.  Just a few
  more small things to do.

* 08/27/1998 - Fixed some bugs the new tests found in the ordered packages.

* 08/27/1998 - Modified the quicksort to speed it up some and to elminate
  anything but swaps to move data.  This avoids calls to the callbacks
  since we are not really adding or removing data elements.

* 08/27/1998 - Added some routines to find links between iterators and
  contained types.

* 08/27/1998 - Finished up the tests and made the makefile run them all
  automatically.

Release 1.0 - 09/04/1998

* 09/02/1998 - Added a Btree container, full tests, and the like.

* 09/03/1998 - Modified makefiles to make krunching easier.

* 09/03/1998 - Converted documenation to LaTeX, did some updates.

Release 1.1 - 02/12/1999

* 02/12/1999 - Released under new license, it now is under the
  GPL with the ACT modifications so that it can be used in proprietary
  programs unemcumbered.

Release 1.x - 

* 06/28/1999 - Fixed a bug in the expandable hash tables that didn't
  allow adding duplicates.  Thanks to Mikko Ala-Fossi for finding
  this one.
